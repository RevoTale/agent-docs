# Overview
Reusable baseline rules for JavaScript-family stacks that use Bun and Biome.

# Core Behaviors & Patterns
- Use Biome as the linter and formatter: https://github.com/biomejs/biome
- Use Biome `recommended` defaults as the baseline configuration.
- Enable all Biome features that fit the current project scope.
- Node.js usage is forbidden; use Bun only: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun
- ESLint and Prettier are forbidden.
